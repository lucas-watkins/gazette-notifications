# About
Get desktop notifications for the gazette. This app uses Python 3 and TKinter.messagebox along with a webscraper to display notifications on your desktop. It displays notifications when it detects a change in the gazette or when your computer wakes up from a shutdown or hibernation.

# Windows Installation
Download and run the installshield installer (coming soon).

# Mac Installation
I have not made plans to port this to mac yet.
